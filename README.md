# EmojiOne Emojis for Signal

## Why?
Well, I didn't want to root my new phone and break the security model of services like AndroidPay. Now we can have our cake and eat it too! By building Signal ourselves, we can simply replace the assets.

## How?
You will have to follow the directions on compiling Signal yourself at their (wiki)[https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/How-to-build-Signal-from-the-sources]. But before you complete the build, be sure to replace the emoji folder with the one in this repo.

## Why not just include the APK?
This breaks the principle of security. Even though I trust myself to be a nice person, you shouldn't. Build the app from the source and use these images. 

## Completeness?
No, this project is not complete. I am missing flags and a few new emojis. It is difficult keeping up. Feel free to send in a pull request and I will accept the changes. This was all made using data scraping so inconsistencies occured.
